## Who I am

My name is Amadeia Rector and I am currently an MPH candidate at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. I am in my second and final year - I have been focusing on epidemiology.

Before pursuing an MPH, I worked at the San Francisco Department of Public Health as a research associate in the HIV Epidemiology Section for 3 years. In this role, I was inspired to further cultivate my interest in epidemiology and develop the skills necessary to investigate the big questions in public health. 

## Hobbies

In my spare time, I enjoy practicing and dancing tango, running, playing tennis, exploring nature, and hosting potlucks.
